Previously, she was the chef and owner at the Beatrice Inn next door, which she acquired from Graydon Carter. (That restaurant closed this year, and Ms. Mar subsequently decided to open this new place instead of recreating the Beatrice.) Now, defying current restaurant norms — bare tables, no dress code, a burger on the menu — this venture features white napery beneath a chandelier that came from the Waldorf Astoria, a French menu that tilts classic and the requirement that men wear jackets (with a supply of vintage YSL on hand). Though Ms. Mar is known for her artistry with slabs of meat, she isn’t offering steak, preferring seafood and birds. “It’s a vast departure, but what I want right now,” she said. The prix-fixe menu ($185) will change frequently but digs deep into French tradition with frog legs and artichokes in beurre blanc, a mousse of veal brains with truffles, sweetbreads wrapped in cabbage, Dover sole with sorrel mousseline, pithiviers (a pastry dome) of crab, and roast pheasant for two. There will be a croquembouche for dessert. Her inspiration comes from chefs like André Soltner and Jacques Pépin; a painting by Mr. Pépin hangs near the bar. Except for a Hungarian Tokay, the wine list is all French and American, and the salonlike room seats 37, plus nine at the bar. Banquettes in inky blue, which Ms. Mar said was the color of her father’s favorite sweatshirt, contrast the creamy ivory of the walls, and touches of that shade show up in the staff’s Christian Siriano-designed outfits. The restaurant’s name, which translates to the three horses, is a nod to what her family called her and her two brothers. (Opens Thursday) ",['Restaurants'],1131

Several fancy confections are included, but most of the cakes tend to be tidy loaves or single layers, perhaps with some crumble or glaze on top and begging for a glass of sweet wine. There are several brownies and blondies, some uncommonly scented with figs and bay leaves; a brownie made with cocoa is a simple delight. Most cookies are easy, made by scooping batter onto baking sheets, and include chocolate chunk with some buckwheat flour for an earthy counterpoint. The author’s photographs are lovely. The recipes I tried all needed a bit more baking time than called for (my ovens are precise, recently calibrated), so the cook should pay more attention to Ms. Ho’s guidelines for testing doneness than to the clock.","['Cooking and Cookbooks', 'Desserts']",207

Now, with his new NoMad workshop, he is delving deeper into the possibilities offered by the genre. “For 12 years working in Paris, it was all I was doing, and I saw how creative you could be,” he said. His idea is to produce classics like a crisp-skinned croissant with a properly honeycombed interior, but also to disrupt the category. So there is a delicious, flaky multigrain croissant, and one made with olive oil, garlic and rosemary. He’s making a type of brioche scented with orange and star anise, another pastry filled with rice pudding and huckleberry jam, and crunchy gougères oozing Comté cheese. The space is just a kitchen with a sales counter, so plan to eat your purchases at the few tables outside or soon after you get them home; Mr. Ansel says their shelf-life is brief.
